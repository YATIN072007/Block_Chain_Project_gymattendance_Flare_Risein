## Description

Gym Attendance is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to record and track gym check-ins on the blockchain. Each time a user marks their attendance, their wallet address and timestamp are permanently stored on-chain, creating a tamper-proof and transparent attendance record system.

This project eliminates the need for traditional centralized attendance systems and replaces them with a trustless, verifiable, and immutable ledger of gym visits.

## Features

- Wallet-based authentication using Web3
- One-click gym check-in using smart contracts
- On-chain timestamped attendance records
- Immutable and transparent storage
- Real-time transaction status tracking
- Error handling and loading state management
- Secure interaction using viem and wagmi

## How It Solves

Traditional gym attendance systems rely on centralized databases that are:

- Vulnerable to data tampering
- Prone to manipulation
- Lacking transparency
- Dependent on trust in the system operator

This project solves these problems by leveraging blockchain technology to:

- Store attendance in a decentralized, immutable way
- Eliminate the possibility of record manipulation
- Provide transparent verification of attendance
- Allow users to prove their consistency without relying on a third party

### Use Cases

- Gyms that want verifiable member attendance
- Fitness challenges based on real check-in data
- Web3-based fitness reward systems
- DAO or community-driven wellness programs

### Benefits

- Trustless system
- No central authority required
- Full transparency
- User-owned identity and activity proof
- Future-ready integration with NFTs and rewards
