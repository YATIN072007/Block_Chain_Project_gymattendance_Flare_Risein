# Gym Attendance Smart Contract DApp

## Contract Address
**Address:** `NOT_SET`  
**Explorer Link:** Not available

## Description

Gym Attendance is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to record and track gym check-ins on the blockchain. Each time a user marks their attendance, their wallet address and timestamp are permanently stored on-chain, creating a tamper-proof and transparent attendance record system.

This project eliminates the need for traditional centralized attendance systems and replaces them with a trustless, verifiable, and immutable ledger of gym visits.

## Features

# Gym Attendance Smart Contract

A beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract and DApp that records gym attendance on-chain. Each check-in stores the user's wallet
address and a timestamp, creating a verifiable, tamper-proof attendance record.

## Contract Address
**Address:** `NOT_SET`
**Explorer Link:** Not available

## Project description
This project shows how simple smart contracts + a frontend can replace centralized attendance systems by providing:

- Immutable attendance records on-chain
- Wallet-based authentication
- Transparent verification of check-ins
- Easy frontend integration using viem and wagmi

## Features

- One-call `checkIn()` function that stores wallet address and timestamp
- Emits events for easy indexing/notifications
- Public queries to fetch attendance history
- Minimal, beginner-friendly Solidity code (useful for learning)
- Frontend + wallet integration examples included

## Use-cases and benefits

- Gyms that want verifiable attendance systems
- Fitness challenges and rewards programs
- Educational demos for Web3 development
- No central server required; users retain control of their proof-of-attendance

## Deployed contract
Deployed Smart Contract Link: **XXX** (replace with actual explorer URL once deployed)

## Smart contract code
See `contract/contract.sol` and `contracts/gymattendance.sol` for on-chain logic.

If you'd like, I can:

- push the combined repository to GitHub (already in progress),
- create a GitHub Actions workflow to auto-deploy the contract or build the site, or
- remove duplicate contract files and standardize the paths.

```solidity
// paste your smart contract code here or look in contract/contract.sol
```
